# How to manage Coder templates

Coder templates are the basis of your Coder deployment. They are the DNA that is used to create your Coder workspaces.

## Templates use cases

You may have a template for each of your teams e.g. a template for your frontend team and a template for your backend team. You can also create a template for each of your projects e.g. a template for your cool-project and a template for your awesome-project.

Moreover, you may have a single template that is used for all your projects but with a different image for each project.
